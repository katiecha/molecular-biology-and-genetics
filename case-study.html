            <h3>Phyllodes Tumor</h3>
            <p>A <strong>phyllodes tumor</strong> is a particular subset of fibroadenoma that can take on benign, borderline, or malignant characteristics. Over ½ of phyllodes tumors are benign and ¼ are malignant.</p>
            <p>Unlike a normal breast cancer, a phyllodes tumor begins in the connective tissue instead of the ducts/glands. Since this is typical of a fibroadenoma, it can be hard to distinguish the two types of tumors from an ultrasound, mammogram, or even biopsy.</p>

            <p>Generally, this form of tumor appears in women around the age of 40. Women with Li-Fraumeni syndrome are more prone to this type of tumor.</p>
            <p>When treating a benign phyllodes tumor, most patients opt for an excisional biopsy. With borderline or malignant tumors, most patients undergo a lumpectomy or partial mastectomy. When a good margin cannot be obtained with this procedure, a mastectomy is chosen for treatment. Patients can also pursue radiation after surgery if margins are not good.</p>
            <p>A malignant phyllodes tumor is unlike regular breast cancers. They are actually treated more like sarcomas as they respond differently to common breast cancer treatments (Phyllodes Tumors of the Breast | American Cancer Society, 2014).</p>

            <h3>My Experience</h3>
            <p>Around 2020, I visited my pediatrician for a regularly scheduled check up, and during this examination, we found a hard lump in my right breast. 
                Shortly after, I consulted with an oncologist who helped me schedule an ultrasound. 
                Through this ultrasound, we confirmed the presence of a tumor, and I proceeded by getting a biopsy. 
                Luckily, the biopsy results were extremely good, and the abnormal lump turned out to be a fibroadenoma. 
                It was the furthest thing I could get from breast cancer and relatively painless.

            <p>For the next year, I got regular ultrasounds to track the growth of the tumor, which stayed relatively the same. 
                Though at one of these visits, my doctor found another lump located deeper within my breast. 
                We began to track this lump as well. As a few more months passed by, this second lump began to grow pretty quickly. 
                My family and I consulted with a surgical oncologist (Dr. Sarma), and she recommended that we continue to follow the growth of the two lumps and only remove one if it became painful or grew larger than 3 centimeters. 
                Since the second lump was only about 1.5 centimeters in width and length, I was not worried.
            </p>

            <p>Near the end of the year, I went to get another ultrasound, and my doctors and I discovered that the second tumor had grown to become over 3 centimeters long and around 2 centimeters wide. 
                I was assured that this secondary tumor was another fibroadenoma and that there was nothing to worry about. 
                Eventually, I decided to pursue an excisional biopsy for peace of mind (and since my college’s winter break was approaching). 
            </p>

            <p>Over my Christmas, I went in to get the tumor surgically removed, and over New Years, I recovered from the surgery. 
                I went back to school excited to start fresh, free from doctor’s appointments and ultrasounds.

            <p>Unfortunately, a few weeks into the spring semester, I got a call from my dad (Dr. Chai). 
                He explained that the pathologist results for the removed tumor were different than we expected. 
                The tumor was a borderline phyllodes tumor. 
                Because of this information, he pushed me to come back home to get a second surgery with better margins (more outside breast tissue needed to be removed). 
            </p>

            <p>Throughout this whole process, I was extremely afraid. 
                I trusted my doctors, which included my dad (Dr. Chai), and I knew almost any breast cancer was not fatal. 
                Even still, I had never been faced with a major health issue as a 17-18-19 year old girl. 
                Also, I was too embarrassed to explain the issue to my friends in college since I had met them only a few months prior. 
                When people were constantly stressed about a midterm or excited about a basketball game, it never seemed like the right time to share a personal health issue. 
            </p>

            <p>Instead of consulting with my friends, I consulted with Google. 
                I had no idea what form of treatment I wanted to pursue. On one hand, I wanted to trust my dad and my doctors. 
                On the other hand, I was growing incredibly concerned with the long term effects of a lumpectomy. 
                I was warned that I may have to pursue reconstructive breast surgery after, which crushed my world as a relatively insecure teenage girl.
