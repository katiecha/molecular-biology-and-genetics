            <p>Genetic discrimination is receiving heightened attention because of the publication of the complete human genome map and sequence. 
              Information from the human genome may make it possible to identify an individual’s lifetime risk of cancer, heart attack, and other diseases. 
              Could this information be used to discriminate in hiring, promotion, or insurance? 
              Employers and insurers could save billions of dollars using predictive genetics to identify, in advance, those of us at risk and then reject workers or policy applicants who are predisposed to develop a disease. 
              Thus, genetic discrimination could be added to the list of other forms of discrimination: racial, ethnic, age, gender, and sexual orientation.
            </p>

            <p>The Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad was charged with conducting genetic testing on employees without their permission. 
              A survey of 2133 employers by the American Management Association found that seven are using genetic testing for either job applicants or employees. 
              Many experts believe that the only solution to potential genetic discrimination is a new federal law that specifically prohibits it.
            </p>

            <p>What is genetic testing and how is it done? Who should benefit from the information gained from the human genome project? 
              How should individual privacy be assured and how could employees of Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad react to the actions of the company? 
              How do we avoid the extremes, such as in the scifi movie “Gattaca”?
